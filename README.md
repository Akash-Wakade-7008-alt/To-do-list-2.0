# 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| HTML5 | Structure |
| CSS3 | Styling & UI Design |
| JavaScript (ES6) | Logic & DOM Manipulation |
| LocalStorage API | Data Persistence |

---

# ⚙️ How It Works

Each day stores tasks separately inside **LocalStorage**:


tasks_monday
tasks_tuesday
tasks_wednesday
...


When the page loads:
- Tasks are fetched from LocalStorage
- Table rows are generated dynamically
- UI updates instantly

No backend required — fully frontend-based.
